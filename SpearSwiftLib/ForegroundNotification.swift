 Abstracts out the NSNotification foreground notification into a class that can be used in a non-NSObject class
 like a ViewModel.

 You can start and stop listening to the notification, which could be done when the view is active / inactive

 To be implemented by a type that knows how to notify its delegate that the App
 has entered the foreground

 ```swift

 //Declare
 private let foregroundNotification: ForegroundNotifyable

 //Delegate
 self.foregroundNotification.delegate = self

 //If this is the Active ViewModel? Is it visible?

 var active: Bool = false {
 didSet {
 if active {
 foregroundNotification.start()
 } else {
 foregroundNotification.stop()
 }
 }
 }

 //Receiving the event, we can do what we need to do when the App become active,
 //like refresh

 extension SummaryViewModel: ForegroundNotificationDelegate {
 fun enteredForeground() {
 refresh()
 }
 }

 ```
